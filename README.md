# Quarkchain_help
Quarkchain.io

I'm an investor in Quarkchain and a big fan of their work.

I've noticed some English spelling, grammar and syntax errors on their new website. This is expected as none of the core team are native English speaking. To help, I decided to scrape their homepage, push to Git and make the necessary changes. I hope this saves them time/money and they use it.

I've seen people on Telegram complain about the 'lack of professionalism' in their translations so hopefully this will help.

Call it Generalised Writing.
